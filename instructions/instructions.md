# Project Overview
The Wellness Monitoring feature is designed to track and visualize athletes' daily wellness data. It will provide coaches and admins with actionable insights to optimize athlete training and recovery.

# Objectives
Enable athletes to submit daily wellness data.
Allow coaches to view, filter, and analyze wellness trends.
Provide visualizations of wellness metrics (e.g., sleep, fatigue, stress).
Ensure secure and scalable data handling with cost-effective solutions.

# Technology Stack
Component	Tool/Platform	Purpose
Frontend	Netlify	Host the React/HTML app for athletes and coaches.
Backend	Vercel	API for data submission, queries, and analytics.
Database	Supabase	Store and manage wellness and athlete data.
Notifications	Supabase + Twilio/Nodemailer	Trigger reminders and alerts.
Development Assistance	Windsurf	Speed up development with AI-powered coding assistance.
